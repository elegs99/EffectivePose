# EffectivePose: Independent Study Project
 
EffectivePose is an Android app that leverages machine learning technology to transform live video streams from a device's camera into 3D body pose estimations. Operating seamlessly in real-time on mobile phones without the need for external tracking devices by accurately capturing and analyzing individuals within the frame, EffectivePose offers an augmented video output that overlays these estimations. Utilizing Googleâ€™s ML Kit, I aim to bring the sophistication of advanced 3D body pose estimation to everyday users. Future extensions of this technology have significant implications across a variety of sectors including sports training, security analysis, and virtual/augmented reality experiences.
